Implementation of Conway's Game of Life


Welcome to ryadmi's "Game of Life" implementation.



## Introduction

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton designed by John Conway. It takes place on a two-dimensional grid where each cell can be alive (containing an entity) or dead (empty). Simple rules dictate the evolution of cells with each generation.



## How to play

1. Download python to your machine.
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/ryadmi/game-of-life-ryadmi.git`
3. Go to the project directory: `cd game-of-life-ryadmi`
4. Launch the game: `python game_of_life.py`

Watch the evolution of the "Game of Life" on your console.
